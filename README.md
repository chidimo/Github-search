## How to run this project

1. Make sure you have `Node.js` (version 12 and above) and `npm` installed.
1. Clone this repository into your local machine with the command

        git clone https://github.com/chidimo/github-search.git

1. Once cloning is done, create a `.env.local` file inside inside the `github-search/` folder and add the below environment variable

        REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="4f262cc9e20d3043da02"

1. To install the project dependencies, `cd` into the `github-search/` folder on a terminal and run the command

        yarn

1. After installation (still in the terminal), start the project by running

        yarn start

1. Once the project is up and running, visit <http://localhost:3000> to view the project.
1. Click the `Login to Github` button to start the authentication process.
1. On the new window, login to your github account and authorize the indicina app. Once done you will be presented with a search box.

## How to run tests

1. To run tests, use the command

        yarn test

## Extra notes

I did implement the dropdown to select either repo or users on the search page. I removed it from the master branch since it wasn't part of the task specification. Its available on the [feature/search-option-dropdown](https://github.com/chidimo/Github-search/tree/feature/search-option-dropdown)

## Notes on styling

I decided to use `css` modules for this app since its simple enough. Personally I prefer styled components (or any other UI library). But I thought it overkill to use any for this exercise.

## Notes on colors

The colors used on the app are an approximation to that in the actual design. This is because I used the browser's dev tools to inspect and pick out colors since I can't exactly get colors off of a figma prototype.
